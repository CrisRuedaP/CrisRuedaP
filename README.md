### Hey! I'm Cristina ðŸ‘‹

A Front-End Developer based in Spain.

I enjoy building clean, simple interfaces and turning ideas into things people can actually use.  Iâ€™m really into UI design â€” especially the little details that make an app feel smooth and enjoyable.

Self-taught, naturally curious, and always exploring new tools, techniques, and challenges to keep growing as a developer.
